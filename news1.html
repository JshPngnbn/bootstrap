        <h2>“My Universe” by Coldplay x BTS Song Review</h2>
        <br />
        <h5>Two Legends Team Up for 2021’S Song of the Year</h5>

        <p>
          Grammy-award winning pop-rock band Coldplay and international
          sensation KPOP group BTS surprised people over the world with their
          recent collaboration. Though rumor mills have been churning over the
          last few months, no one was really sure. But alas! “My Universe”
          finally came out as a single of the two legendary music artists we
          have in this decade.
        </p>

        <p>
          People are saying no one has seen this collaboration in the making
          possible. But BTS were and have always expressed their admiration
          towards Coldplay. SO at one point, ARMYs (fans of BTS) have always
          wished for the two bands to come together and make music. The
          impossible happened.
        </p>
        <h5>“My Universe” Takes the IM- out of IMPOSSIBLE</h5>
        <p>
          As soon as the news of Coldplay and BTS teaming up, the internet went
          wild and almost broke. Two of the most best-selling bands of all time
          are collaborating. While Coldplay and BTS are an unusual paring, fans
          from both sides are ecstatic. Coldplay has always been known for
          crafting poetic songs, and even though they are working together with
          another artist with “My Universe,” they never lost their own touch of
          style. But of course, BTS also contributed their own style and
          technique to the song. “My Universe” becomes more sentimental with
          their unique voices. The new single is as poetic as it can get. For
          those who have not heard the song yet (as I am sure it is being played
          everywhere right now given that two legendary bands are paired
          together, “My Universe” starts of with a tuneful of pop-rock melody—a
          style that both groups are known for. The catchy melodious is kept up
          for most of the song until we hear two members from BTS with their
          signature rap. It turns up the song even better. The contrast is
          admirable.
        </p>
        <h5>What is “My Universe” All About?</h5>
        <p>
          Both Coldplay and BTS are known for their charitable acts, aside from
          being talented musicians. The two groups have always been vocal with
          preaching love, unity, and empowerment. This single from them is
          definitely a catchy and inspiring song about togetherness. With the
          pandemic still plaguing the world, “My Universe” is the right cheering
          everyone needed. The lyrics are poignant and straight to the point, as
          they are written by members of the two legendary groups themselves. As
          many fans describe, “My Universe” is a euphoria. It sparks joy. It
          sparks a unity revolution, especially with the unusual pairing of
          musicians we have. From their act of collaboration alone, Coldplay and
          BTS are already showing togetherness—that people can be one in times
          of hardships even though they are from different parts of the world.
          The song itself, along with the team up, is no doubt a powerful
          message for all their fans and listeners in the world. It applies to
          everyone, whether young or old, male or female, and whatever social
          divide there still is. “My Universe” is for everyone in this world who
          needs to hear something positive.
