        <h2>Tom Odell: Monster Album Review</h2>
        <i> Chaotic, depressive, beautiful - Tom Odell is feeling the blues</i>
        <br />
        <p>
          More popularly known as Tom Odell, Thomas Peter Odell has recently
          released his fourth album, ‘Monsters.’ The platinum-selling UK-born
          singer pours his heart out with 16 new tracks. While his past releases
          were sappy and romantic, Odell shows a different side with this latest
          one.
        </p>
        <h5>Are Monsters Real?</h5>
        <p>
          As an alternative indie artist, Tom Odell finds unique ways to
          transcend the genre. For this new work of his, the title track bears
          the same name as the album. But the title track comes in two versions:
          Monster v.1 and Monster v.2, one of which is acoustic and rawer. It
          begs a few questions, what is the album about? What or who are these
          monsters? Most importantly, are monsters real?
        </p>
        <i>“You’re just a monster, and I’m not scared.”</i>
        <p>
          The creative singer-songwriter has indeed put his heart out on his
          sleeves with ‘Monsters.’ It is without a doubt that their personal
          experiences inspire many artists to write songs, and we can certainly
          hear Tom Odell’s life with his recent album. In an interview, the
          soloist has opened up about how he has been experiencing panic attacks
          and anxiety, especially with the world’s current situation under a
          deadly pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Odell wrote the title track to feel better with the “monsters” he was
          feeling, and he did. He said songwriting has always helped him
          liberate his emotions, which is very obvious with how he wrote the
          lyrics to the title track. A personal favorite verse of mine in
          Monster is “You’re just a monster, and I’m not scared.”
        </p>
        <h5>Diving Into The B-Sides</h5>
        <p>
          Having 16 tracks in the album means there is so much more to listen to
          than just the title track. The other songs can still be seen as an
          appeal to Tom’s current struggles with his mental and emotional
          well-being, with titles such as ‘Problems,’ ‘Numb,’ and ‘Don’t Be
          Afraid Of The Dark,’ to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every song has that narrative effect as if Tom Odell is merely talking
          to listeners like long-time friends catching up. The entire
          discography is a good mix and match of upbeat and mournful. One song
          tugs your heart one minute, and the next, you are probably thinking of
          leading a revolution. Tom did not only write about his depression. But
          as well as the many different oppression people are experiencing all
          over the world, like a subtle commentary on how money is the root of
          all evil with his song ironically called ‘Money.’ He also shares his
          lockdown journey with the song entitled ‘Lockdown.’
